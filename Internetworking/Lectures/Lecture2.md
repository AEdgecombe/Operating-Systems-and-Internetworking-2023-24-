# IP Addresses & Subnets

### IP Protocol

The Internet Protocol (IP) is a fundamental communication protocol that enables devices to connect and exchange data across a network, including the internet. It provides a standardized way for devices to identify and locate each other, ensuring efficient routing of data packets.

### IP Functions

* **Addressing:** IP assigns unique addresses to devices, allowing them to be recognized and reached within the network.

* **Routing:** IP facilitates the delivery of data packets between devices by determining the optimal path through the network.

* **Fragmentation:** IP breaks down large data packets into smaller units for efficient transmission and reassembles them at the destination.

* **Encapsulation:** IP encapsulates data packets with source and destination addresses, enabling them to travel across different network segments.

### IP Notation Methods

* **Dotted Decimal Notation:** The most common representation, expressing an IP address as four decimal numbers separated by dots, e.g., 192.168.1.100.

* **Binary Notation:** Represents an IP address as a 32-bit binary number, e.g., 11000000.10101000.00000001.01100100.

* **Hexadecimal Notation:** Expresses an IP address as eight hexadecimal digits, e.g., C0.A8.01.64.

### IP Address Structure

An IP address consists of two main parts:

* **Network ID:** Identifies the network to which the device belongs.

* **Host ID:** Identifies the specific device within the network.

### IP Addressing

IP addressing is the process of assigning IP addresses to devices on a network. There are two main approaches:

* **Static IP Addressing:** Manually assigning a fixed IP address to a device.

* **Dynamic IP Addressing:** Automatically assigning IP addresses to devices using a protocol like DHCP.

### Subnetting

Subnetting is the division of a larger network into smaller subnetworks or subnets. It allows for better organization, traffic management, and security within a network.

* **Subnet Mask:** A 32-bit number that identifies the network and host portions of an IP address.

* **CIDR Notation:** A compact representation of subnet masks, e.g., /24 indicates a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0.

### Summary

IP addresses and subnets are essential components of networking, enabling devices to communicate effectively and efficiently. Understanding their structure, functions, and notation methods is crucial for network administration and configuration.
